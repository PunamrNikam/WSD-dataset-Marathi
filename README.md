# WSD-dataset-Marathi
This repository contains a manually curated test dataset for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in the Marathi language. The dataset is intended for research and evaluation of WSD models and includes words with multiple meanings along with their glosses (definitions) and example usages in context.

The dataset is stored in a JSON format and contains entries with the following fields:
word: A polysemous word in Marathi.
gloss: The specific sense or definition of the word in a given context.
example: A sentence from Marathi Wikipedia or another resource where the word is used, helping disambiguate its meaning.
